    {
      "question": "How quickly can you repair my hydraulic ram?",
      "answer": "We offer express same-day service for urgent repairs where parts are in stock. Standard repairs typically take 2-3 working days depending on the extent of work required. Upon inspection, we'll provide you with an accurate timeline and can prioritise emergency cases to minimise your downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of hydraulic cylinders can you repair?",
      "answer": "We repair all types of hydraulic cylinders including single-acting, double-acting, telescopic, and custom-designed cylinders. Our facility can handle cylinders from small actuators right up to large industrial rams with bore diameters up to 300mm and lengths up to 2.2 meters. We work on all major brands and can source or manufacture replacement parts as needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does hydraulic ram repair cost?",
      "answer": "Repair costs vary depending on the cylinder size, extent of damage, and parts required. Simple seal replacements start from around ¬£150, while complete rebuilds of large cylinders can be several thousand pounds. We provide detailed quotes after inspection, with no hidden charges. Often, repair is 40-60% less expensive than replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer on-site hydraulic repair services?",
      "answer": "While we primarily operate from our fully-equipped Sandbach workshop for precision repairs, we can arrange collection and delivery services throughout the UK. For large or fixed installations, we can provide on-site assessment and some field repairs, though most precision work requires our workshop facilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What warranty do you provide on repairs?",
      "answer": "All our hydraulic ram repairs come with a 12-month warranty covering workmanship and parts replaced during the repair. This includes all seals, chrome plating, honing work, and machining. The warranty is valid under normal operating conditions and covers any defects in our repair work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you manufacture replacement parts if originals are unavailable?",
      "answer": "Yes, we have full manufacturing capabilities for custom hydraulic components including pistons, rods, glands, and cylinders. If OEM parts are obsolete or unavailable, we can reverse-engineer and manufacture replacements to exact specifications, often improving on the original design for better longevity."
