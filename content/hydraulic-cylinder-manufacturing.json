  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you manufacture cylinders to replace obsolete components?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialise in reverse-engineering obsolete hydraulic cylinders where original manufacturers no longer support the equipment. We can often improve on the original design while maintaining mounting compatibility, providing better performance and longer service life."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical lead time for custom manufacturing?",
      "answer": "Lead times vary depending on complexity and current workload. Simple cylinders with materials in stock can often be completed same-day or next-day. Complex custom designs typically take 5-10 working days. We'll provide accurate timelines with your quote and can expedite urgent requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide technical design support?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Our engineers can assist with application analysis, material selection, mounting design, and performance optimisation. We use 3D CAD systems and can provide detailed drawings and stress analysis to ensure optimal performance for your specific application."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you manufacture high-pressure cylinders?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly manufacture cylinders for operating pressures up to 700 bar. High-pressure cylinders require special attention to material selection, seal design, and safety factors. We design and test all high-pressure systems to appropriate safety standards with full certification."
    },
    {
      "question": "What materials and surface treatments are available?",
      "answer": "We work with various steel grades including EN24, EN8, stainless steel 316/304, and specialist alloys. Surface treatments include hard chrome plating, nitriding, anodising, and protective coatings. Material selection depends on your operating environment, pressure requirements, and compatibility needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer warranty on custom manufactured cylinders?",
      "answer": "Yes, all custom manufactured cylinders come with a 12-month warranty covering materials, workmanship, and performance. This includes all seals, surface treatments, and assembly work. We stand behind our manufacturing quality and provide ongoing technical support throughout the product lifecycle."
