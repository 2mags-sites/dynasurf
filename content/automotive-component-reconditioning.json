    {
      "question": "Can you recondition components for classic cars?",
      "answer": "Yes, we specialise in reconditioning automotive components for classic and vintage vehicles where original parts are no longer available. We can restore worn components to original specifications while maintaining authenticity, including original part numbers and appearance where required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do reconditioned parts compare to new OEM parts?",
      "answer": "Reconditioned parts often exceed new OEM specifications due to our chrome plating and precision finishing processes. The hard chrome surface provides superior wear resistance compared to original materials, potentially lasting longer than the original component while maintaining exact dimensional compatibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical cost saving versus new parts?",
      "answer": "Reconditioning typically costs 40-60% less than new OEM parts, with even greater savings for obsolete or specialist components. The exact saving depends on the component complexity and availability of new parts. We provide detailed cost comparisons to help you make informed decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you handle high-performance racing components?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We regularly recondition high-performance and racing components including competition gearbox parts, racing engine components, and performance modifications. Our processes can enhance durability for racing applications while maintaining precise tolerances required for maximum performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does automotive reconditioning take?",
      "answer": "Turnaround times vary depending on the component and processes required. Simple chrome plating and grinding typically takes 5-7 working days, while complex restorations may take 10-14 days. We offer express service for urgent requirements and provide accurate timelines with quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide warranty on reconditioned automotive parts?",
      "answer": "Yes, all reconditioned automotive components come with a 12-month warranty covering workmanship, chrome plating, and dimensional accuracy. This warranty covers the quality of our reconditioning work and demonstrates our confidence in the durability and performance of restored components."
