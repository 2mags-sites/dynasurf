  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What sizes of hydraulic hose can you manufacture?",
      "answer": "We can manufacture hydraulic hose assemblies from 1/4\" up to 2\" diameter in virtually any length required. Our equipment handles both metric and imperial sizing, with working pressures from low-pressure return lines up to ultra-high-pressure applications exceeding 10,000 PSI."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you manufacture custom hose assemblies?",
      "answer": "Most standard hydraulic hose assemblies can be manufactured on the same day or next working day. For urgent breakdowns, we offer a same-day emergency service. More complex assemblies or specialized hoses may require 2-3 days depending on material availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you test every hose assembly?",
      "answer": "Yes, every hydraulic hose assembly we manufacture is pressure tested to 1.5 times its working pressure rating before dispatch. This ensures the integrity of both the hose and crimped connections. We provide test certificates when required for quality assurance purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of fittings and connections do you offer?",
      "answer": "We stock a comprehensive range of hydraulic fittings including BSP, NPT, JIC, SAE O-ring, Metric, and many specialty fittings. We can also source custom or obsolete fittings when required. Our crimping equipment handles both permanent and field-repairable connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you match existing hose specifications?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Bring us your existing hose assembly or provide specifications, and we'll manufacture exact replacements. We can also upgrade to higher specification hoses if your application demands have changed or if you want improved durability and longer service life."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer installation services?",
      "answer": "While we primarily focus on manufacturing hose assemblies, we can provide guidance on installation and recommend trusted installation partners for complex hydraulic system work. We also supply all necessary adaptors, clamps, and accessories for proper installation."
