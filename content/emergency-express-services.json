  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergency hydraulic failures?",
      "answer": "We guarantee 2-hour response to emergency calls, including initial assessment and action plan. Collection service can be arranged within 4 hours for most UK locations. Simple repairs with parts in stock can often be completed same-day, while complex work receives absolute priority for completion within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "What constitutes an emergency service requirement?",
      "answer": "Emergency service applies to critical equipment failures where standard repair timelines would cause significant production losses, safety issues, or operational disruption. This includes harvest-time agricultural equipment, production line machinery, construction equipment on critical projects, and any situation where downtime costs exceed express service premiums."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is emergency service available outside normal hours?",
      "answer": "Yes, our emergency hotline operates 24/7 including weekends and bank holidays. While our workshop operates normal hours Monday-Friday, we can arrange emergency work sessions for truly critical situations. Collection and delivery services can be arranged outside normal hours for urgent requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs for emergency express service?",
      "answer": "Emergency service attracts premium pricing due to priority scheduling, dedicated resources, and outside-hours availability. Typical premiums are 50-100% above standard service costs, but this is often justified by avoiding costly downtime. We provide upfront pricing for emergency work with cost-benefit analysis against downtime costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you handle large or complex emergency repairs?",
      "answer": "Yes, our emergency service covers all types and sizes of hydraulic repairs within our capacity (cylinders up to 300mm diameter, 2.2m length). Complex repairs may take longer but receive absolute priority. For very large components, we can arrange special handling and accelerated processing to minimise downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do emergency repairs carry the same warranty as standard work?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. All emergency repairs carry our full 12-month warranty covering workmanship and materials. The urgency of the work never compromises our quality standards or warranty coverage. Emergency work often receives additional inspection due to the critical nature of the application."
