      "Cylinder tube honing is a precision machining process that creates a perfectly smooth, cross-hatched surface finish inside hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders. This specialised abrasive machining process removes imperfections, restores proper geometry, and creates the ideal surface texture for optimal seal performance and longevity.",
      "At Dynasurf, we utilise advanced honing equipment capable of handling cylinders up to 300mm internal diameter and 2.2 meters in length - capabilities that set us apart from most competitors. Our honing process addresses common cylinder problems including scratches, scoring, corrosion, ovality, taper, and general wear.",
      "The cross-hatch pattern created by honing is crucial for proper lubrication retention, ensuring smooth operation and extending seal life. Our precision honing achieves surface finishes between Ra 0.2 to 0.4 microns, meeting or exceeding manufacturer specifications."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What size cylinders can you hone?",
      "answer": "We can hone cylinders from 25mm up to 300mm internal diameter and up to 2.2 meters in length. This capacity allows us to handle everything from small pneumatic cylinders to large industrial hydraulic tubes. For cylinders outside these dimensions, please contact us to discuss alternative solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much material does honing remove?",
      "answer": "Typically, honing removes between 0.02mm to 0.5mm of material from the bore diameter, depending on the severity of damage. Light honing for surface finish improvement removes minimal material, while heavy honing to eliminate deep scratches or restore geometry may remove more. We always measure and advise on seal size adjustments if necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical turnaround time for honing?",
      "answer": "Standard honing service typically takes 2-3 working days. However, we offer express same-day or next-day service for urgent requirements. The exact timeline depends on cylinder size, quantity, and current workload. We'll provide an accurate timeline upon inspection and can prioritise emergency work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can honing fix a badly scored cylinder?",
      "answer": "Yes, honing can repair most scored cylinders, provided the scoring isn't too deep. Scores up to 0.5mm deep can typically be removed through honing. For deeper damage, we may recommend sleeving the cylinder or manufacturing a new tube. We'll assess your cylinder and recommend the most cost-effective solution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What surface finish can you achieve?",
      "answer": "We typically achieve surface finishes between Ra 0.2 to 0.4 microns, which is ideal for most hydraulic and pneumatic applications. We can adjust the finish to meet specific requirements - rougher for better oil retention in slow-moving applications, or finer for high-speed pneumatic cylinders. The cross-hatch angle is also optimised for your specific application."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide measurement reports?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide comprehensive measurement reports including before and after dimensions, surface finish readings, and cylindricity measurements. These reports serve as quality certification and help you maintain maintenance records. Digital photographs of the honed surface can also be provided upon request."
